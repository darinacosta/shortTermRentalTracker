  <h3>EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SHORT TERM RENTALS ON THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS</h3>
  <p>
    Utilizing data that is <b>updated every two weeks</b> from Airbnb and HomeAway — two major <b>short term rental (STR)</b> providers — this website helps to create a framework for better understanding the impact of unpermitted short term rentals on the city of New Orleans. <b>Our data does not account for all listings</b>; it is provided as a representative subset. In reality, the short term rental market is much larger than what is presented on this website.
  </p>
  <p>
    We consider the most important issues related to short term rentals to be centered around housing affordability and access. Our analysis of the effects of short term rentals on New Orleans is separated into six parts:

      <h3 id="rentalCompetition">THE RENTAL COMPETITION: TRANSIENTS VS. RESIDENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Long term residents are competing with tourists over a limited supply of affordable housing stock.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The unchecked conversion of residential housing into what is essentially commercial space impacts the housing market by constricting supply and increasing demand. Less supply and more demand means higher rent for long term residents in one of the <a href="http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/new-orleans-one-of-the-worst-us-cities-for-renters/Content?oid=2609106" target="_blank">worst U.S. cities for renters</a>. 
      <p>
        <b>In other words: Short term rentals reduce the amount of available housing for long term residents while making the housing that is still available more expensive</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        New Orleans has a serious <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/cities-housing-rental-affordability-new-orleans/399695/" target="_blank">affordable housing problem</a>. We don’t believe short term rentals created this problem. However, they have made it worse. Over the past decade, <a href="http://www.nola.com/business/baton-rouge/index.ssf/2013/08/louisiana_unemployment_wages_r.html" target="_blank">wages have remained stagnant</a> while <a href="http://nlihc.org/oor/louisiana" target="_blank">the cost of living has increased</a>. These factors have coincided with a demographic shift in the city of New Orleans towards a <a href="http://nlihc.org/oor/louisiana" target="_blank">wealthier, whiter population</a>. Residents being forced to keep pace with out-of-town dollars for basic amenities like housing exacerbates <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/magazine/why-new-orleans-black-residents-are-still-under-water-after-katrina.html?_r=1" target="_blank">this ongoing conflict</a>.

      <p>
        Websites like Airbnb are <a href="http://sfist.com/2015/04/27/planning_department_wont_force_airb.php" target="_blank">intentionally opaque</a>. <b>During our data collection, Airbnb became increasingly less transparent with their information.</b> In mid-August of 2015, Airbnb removed a feature from its site that exhibited the number of rentals belonging to individual hosts. A user profile had previously included a sidebar panel with the number of listings for the individual user, along with links to their rental listings. That information is no longer available.
      </p>
      <p>
        This removal of information is part of a wider transparency issue. Short term rental websites like Airbnb are the public faces of large corporations that tightly control their data.  Airbnb and other short term rental websites intentionally withhold <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/airbnb-and-the-problem-of-data/" target="_blank">comprehensive sets of user data</a> — like statistics regarding the number of units available in a particular city or the frequency of bookings for any listing — that would help residents, consumers, and policymakers easily understand the impacts of short term rentals on a city’s housing market.

    <div class="col-md-12">          <!--begin myth vs reality 2-->
      <p>
        <b>Concealing this information protects a major short term rental myth that can be dispelled through data: <a href="https://pando.com/2013/12/08/airbnb-says-this-man-does-not-exist-so-i-had-coffee-with-him/" target="_blank">the myth of the spare bedroom</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the talking points of short term rental advocates is that websites like Airbnb allow homeowners to subsidize their housing expenses by occasionally renting out an extra room. In reality, the majority of short term rental listings are for entire homes or apartments. <b>Of the {{stats.listingTotals.air}} Airbnb listings tracked between June of 2015 and today, <span ng-bind="entireRoomPercent"></span>% were listed as “entire home/apartment.”</b>
      </p>

    <div class="col-lg-12"> <!--begin myth v reality prt 2-->
      <p>
        While the density of short term listings is remarkable, the intensity of use varies between listings. Not every listing on Airbnb is being rented on a regular basis. Rather, the listings most likely to be rented at the highest frequency are those reserved strictly for short term purposes. These types of rentals are operated as businesses, commonly by hosts with multiple listings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Of the {{stats.listingTotals.air}} Airbnb listings that we have tracked, there are only {{stats.multiListingUsers.total}} hosts. {{stats.multiListingUsers.twoplus}} hosts have 2 or more properties. {{stats.multiListingUsers.fiveplus}} have 5 or more properties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If renting out a spare room could be considered to be a side hustle, renting out multiple entire apartments or homes should be considered a full on business.

      </p>
      <p>
        Some argue that Airbnb is a way for more people to be able to make money off of tourists, dispersing tourist dollars into more communities. Unfortunately, short term rentals don’t equal a more equitable tourist economy. Rather, they’re only profitable for those with assets, such as a house (or houses) in a desirable neighborhood and reliable access to the internet.

It’s <a href="http://nola.curbed.com/archives/2015/06/04/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-renting-in-new-orleans.php" target="_blank">a difficult place to be a renter</a>. Other cities have enacted legal protections for renters. These protections include <a href="http://www.policylink.info/EDTK/JustCause/" target="_blank">just cause for evictions</a>, meaning there is a set list of reasons why a tenant can legally be evicted. Some cities limit the amount rents can be raised annually.

      <p>
        New Orleans doesn’t have rent control; it also doesn’t have just cause eviction protection. This effectively allows landlords to dispose of undesirable tenants by waiting until the expiration of the lease—many of which are month-to-month—and refusing to renew the lease. This leaves renters vulnerable to expulsion for any reason, <a href="http://www.orleanscdc.com/forms/fcc/fcc_eviction_brochure.pdf" target="_blank">with notice being as short as five days</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Without adequate renter’s rights, there is nothing standing in the way of landlords kicking out their long term renters to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpLi0c5M3FA" target="_blank">make way for tourists</a>.

However, single-listing users are also playing an active role in reshaping the residential neighborhoods of the city. While some hosts using Airbnb cite the need to supplement their incomes in order to remain in their homes, these individual choices aggregate and extend beyond their property line. The overall effect on the city is harmful, especially to low and moderate income residents already dealing with <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/08/new_orleans_will_need_33000_ne.html#incart_2box_nola_river_orleans_news" target="_blank">the increasing pressure of an affordable housing crisis</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Short term rentals remove long term housing options from the market. The elimination of options forces residents to jockey for whatever is left in an inflated housing market without adequate protections for renters. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The spread of tourism into residential neighborhoods is pushing out the people who live there. The people most likely to be affected by unforgiving economics are not the same individuals profiting off of a swelling tourist economy. Companies like Airbnb benefit tourists and the limited number of hosts who choose to rent to them. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.

    <h3>DATA DISCLAIMER</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The coordinates of the data points featured on the map are provided by the short term rental listing websites, and the spatial accuracy is not precise</b>. They are not associated with specific addresses, and are only intended to communicate the general area of the listing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our data <b>does not represent all current Airbnb and HomeAway listings</b>, and is meant to serve as a representative subset. Our methods are designed for frequent data updates, but at the expense of cataloguing the entirety of listings. <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/" target="_blank">Inside Airbnb</a> does an impressive job of visualizing a complete snapshot of Airbnb in New Orleans using data that was collected in July of 2015. The listing numbers at the time of collection for Airbnb alone was over 2500. We believe that the state of the short term rental market in New Orleans is more dramatic than our subset of data suggests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although both the spatial and non-spatial data featured across the site have been produced and processed from information that is publicly advertised on vacation rental websites, no warranty is made regarding accuracy, adequacy, completeness, legality, reliability or usefulness of the data.
