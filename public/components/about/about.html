<p>The Nola Short Term Rental Report is a living document. The content and data is likely to improve as research and analysis continue. The listings featured on the map are collected using the <a href="https://zilyo.com/" target="_blank">Zilyo</a> API. After these listings are compiled, the individual listings in this compiled list are analyzed in order to collect additional data on the listings themselves and on user behavior. The data is updated every three days. For a more detailed analysis of data related specifically to Airbnb both in New Orleans and in many other cities, please visit <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/" target="_blank">Inside Airbnb</a>.</p>
